# Distributed Controller-Workers system

The app is designed as a framework that should minimize effort needed to add new types of work.
This initial implementation only can brute force using different types of alphabets now. I’m planning to add vocabulary and cryptography in future. But it’s designed to be a generic runner. 

Deployment will be done to managed and unmanaged kubernetes clusters. 

The app is not in a working state now.
A lot has to be covered with tests.

Contributions are welcomed. There is a bunch of stuff to do.
